  abstract = {It is possible to generate sequences of oligomeric nucleic acids
              which will preferentially associate to form migrationally immobile
              junctions, rather than linear duplexes, as they usually do. These
              structures are predicated on the maximization of Watson-Crick base
              pairing and the lack of sequence symmetry customarily found in
              their analogs in living systems. Criteria are presented which
              oligonucleotide sequences must fulfill in order to yield these
              junction structures. The generable junctions are nexi, from which 3
              to 8 double helices may emanate. Each junction may be treated as a
              macromolecular “valence cluster”, and the individual clusters may
              be linked together directly, or with pieces of linear DNA
              interspersed between them. This covalent linkage can be done with
              enormous specificity, using the sticky-ended ligation techniques
              currently employed in genetic engineering studies. It appears to be
              possible to generate covalently joined three-dimensional networks
              of nucleic acids which are periodic in connectivity and perhaps in
              space.},
